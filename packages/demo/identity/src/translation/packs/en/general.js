  whatIsThis: 'What is this?',
  whatIsThisPara1: 'This is a proof-of-concept demo to showcase use cases of blockchain identity (ERC 725) and claims made against the identity (ERC 735) from the perspective of a user or verifier. It is on Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Kovan Test Networks.',
  whatIsThisPara2: 'A user refers to someone who wants to verify certain data (name, address, email, etc) and store the signed verification claim to the blockchain.',
  whatIsThisPara: 'A verifier refers to someone who receives and verifies the data off-chain. On successful verification, the verifier signs the data and return it to the user.',

  howDoesItWork: 'How do I try this out?',
  howDoesItWorkPara1: '1. Start off with the ‘User’ perspective.',
  howDoesItWorkPara2: '2. Choose the data you want to verify.',
  howDoesItWorkPara3: '3. Once you have made a verification request, swap to a \‘Verifier\' and approve or reject the verification requests.',
  howDoesItWorkPara4: '4. Switch back to ‘User’ and proceed to put the claim on the blockchain.',

  whyImportant: 'Why is this important?',
  whyImportantPara1: 'This Proof-of-Concept showcases the entire flow for both users and verifiers, within a beautiful and easy user experience. More importantly, it highlights the core technical elements of decentralised identity and claims made against the user. We will continue to build upon this proof-of-concept demo with additional features, such as registering Stellar addresses, interface to look up public identities and claims, making self-asserted claims.',
